 shinto_events.23.d:0 "While the main strand of philosophy was once the transition from Traditional Japanese values to the more rationalist approach of the Chinese, the focus of philosophers and scholars have now moved on to individual responsibility. Too much focus on intellect disregards the actual feelings of love and empathy which are the foundations of a functioning society.\nThe interpretations and discussions of the Analects will likely continue. As they do, however, a much larger segment of society can partake due to the now widespread literacy and familiarity with the Classics and Books."
