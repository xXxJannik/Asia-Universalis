 XMP_vajrayana_buddhism:0 "Vajrayana Buddhism"
 XMP_vajrayana_buddhism_desc:0 "Our people are united in our own unique view of the world represented through our Thunderbolt form of Buddhism. It guides our very governance and daily life in familiar and expected patterns for the lowest serf to the highest lama."
 XMP_bon_influence:0 "Bön Influence."
 XMP_bon_influence_desc:0 "The vestiges of the original and indigenous Bön faith still hold sway in Tibet, both competing with and merging with the Vajrayana way of Buddhism. The divine presences or Bön deities are incorporated into the very construction of the people's homes making them in effect a castle (dzongka) against the malevolent forces outside it. The fierce and inspiring Gods, Elementals, Demons, and Spirits are quite a contrast to the serene Buddha."
 XMP_yaks:0 "Yaks!"
 XMP_yaks_desc:0 "Domesticated yaks have been kept for thousands of years by our people, cultivating and improving our knowledge of their breeding will only make them more useful. In addition to pulling plows and being able to ride them, they give us their milk, fibre and meat, and carry a heavy load through deep snow. Their dried droppings are an important fuel, used all over Tibet, and is often the only fuel available on the high treeless Tibetan Plateau. Their butter is an ingredient of the butter tea that Tibetans consume in large quantities, and is also used in lamps and made into butter sculptures used in religious festivities. Their use is ever expanding with our knowledge and ingenuity."
 XMP_way_of_virtue:0 "The Way of Virtue"
 XMP_way_of_virtue_desc:0 "Dgelugspa, also known as the Yellow Hat sect, is a school of Vajrayana Buddhism focusing on principles of universal compassion as the fundamental spiritual orientation. Founded in the late 14th century, the Dgelugspa became the pre-eminent Buddhist school in Tibet since the end of the 16th century. "
 XMP_potala_palace:0 "Potala Palace"
 XMP_potala_palace_desc:0 "Construction of the Potala Palace began in 1645, under the direction of Lozang Gyatso, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama. Rising a thousand feet above the valley floor in Lhasa, with stone walls that measure sixteen feet thick at the base, this fortified palace commands an impressive place. Within its thirteen stories, this center of government has over 1,000 rooms, 10,000 shrines and 200,000 statues. "
 XMP_way_of_ancients:0 "The Way of the Ancients"
 XMP_way_of_ancients_desc:0 "Nyingma, also known as the School of the Ancient Translations is the oldest school of Vajrayana Buddhism, incorporating mysticism and local deities shared by the pre-Buddhist Bön religion. Historically, the Nyingma tradition is unique amongst the schools in that its supporters never held political power, and therefore its practitioners were mostly removed from the political machinations of Tibet, focusing on austerity, celibacy and mysticism. Their presence, however, cultivates discipline in our society and keeps us attuned to our roots."
 XMP_pale_earth:0 "The Pale Earth School"
 XMP_pale_earth_desc:0 "The Pale Earth, or Sakya School of Vajrayana Buddhism, derives its name from the unique grey landscape of Ponpori Hills in southern Tibet near Shigatse, where Sakya Monastery, the first monastery of this tradition was built by Khon Konchog Gyalpo (1034–1102) in 1073. The Sakya tradition was founded in the late 11th century by Drogmi, a famous scholar and translator who had studied at Vikramashila University in India. This school is known for its studious and academic bent and its colleges produce Tibet's most inquisitive minds."

 XMP_TIB.11.a:0 "An orderly process is best"
 XMP_TIB.12.t:0 "A Completed Search"
 XMP_TIB.12.d:0 "A rigorous process has been used to determine the possible reincarnations of the previous Dalai Lama. For the final assessment, the candidates were presented with a group of items, and a few have successfully recognized those which belonged to His Holiness. With multiple candidates having been identified, the true successor must be found!"
 XMP_TIB.13.t:0 "A Young Dalai Lama"
 XMP_TIB.13.d:0 "With the recent passing of the Dalai Lama, the Lama's yangsi, being so young, has been judged to be too inexperienced to take on the responsibilities of governance. A regency council of High Lamas has been organized to take on this role until His Holiness comes of age."

 XMP_TIB.2.t:0 "The Tea-Horse Road"
 XMP_TIB.2.d:0 "Our recent annexation of the Dali Bai has led to an influx of caravans and tea porters along the old paths of the Tea-Horse Road.

 XMP_TIB.5.d:0 "Our recent development projects in the Sichuan Basin have led some spice traders to seek to use the well-established southern trade network leading to the massive Indian ports along the Bay of Bengal rather than the northern Silk Road.

 XMP_TIB.7.t:0 "Cashmere Wool Industry"
